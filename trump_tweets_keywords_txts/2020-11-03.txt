Over the next 4 years, we will teach our children to love our Country, honor our history, and always respect our great American Flag—and with God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, and the right to KEEP AND BEAR ARMS!

The Supreme Court decision on voting in Pennsylvania is a VERY dangerous one. It will allow rant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!
