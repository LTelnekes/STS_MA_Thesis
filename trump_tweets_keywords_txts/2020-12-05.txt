See you tonight at 7PM, Georgia!
I will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification. Has not been done and will show large scale discrepancies. Why are these two “Republicans” saying no? If we win Georgia, everything else falls in place!
25, wow! I am surprised there are so many. We have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS. I read the Fake News Washington Post as little as possible!
Leaving for Georgia now. See you soon!
...We received more LEGAL votes by far. All I can do is run, caign, and be a good (great!) President – it is 100% up to the states to manage the election. Republicans will NEVER forget this.
Between Governor of Arizona and Governor of Georgia, the Democrat Party could not be happier. They fight harder against us than do the Radical Left Dems. If they were with us, we would have already won both Arizona and Georgia...
