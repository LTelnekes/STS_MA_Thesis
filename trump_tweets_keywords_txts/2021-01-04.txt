How can you certify an election when the numbers being certified are verifiably WRONG. You will see the real numbers tonight during my speech, but especially on JANUARY 6th. Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET!
“We’ve seen in the last few months, unprecedented amounts of Voter Fraud.” True!
The “Surrender Caucus” within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective “guardians” of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!
Heading to Georgia now. See you soon!
