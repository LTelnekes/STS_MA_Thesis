“these actions on the part of state officials, making these changes, were violating the constitution of the u.s. they were usurping power.” ken starr
state officials were ignorant of the limitations imposed by the constitution. ken starr

“georgia is not the only state that pushed through these last minute rules changes before the presidential election.” they forgot about our constitution!
georgia lt. governor is a rino never trumper who got himself elected as lg by falsely claiming to be “pro-trump”. too dumb or corrupt to recognize massive evidence of fraud in ga & should be replaced! we need every great georgian to call him out! specialsession!
thank you georgia!
georgia is watching , , and !
i hope house republicans will vote against the very weak national defense authorization act (ndaa), which i will veto. must include a termination of section 230 (for national security purposes), preserve our national monuments, & allow for 5g & troupe reductions in foreign lands!
