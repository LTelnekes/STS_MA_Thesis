must see takedown of the horrible, inaccurate and anything but secure dominion voting system which is used in states where tens of thousands of votes were stolen from us and given to biden. likewise, the great has a confirming and powerful piece!
these states in question should immediately be put in the trump win column. biden did not win, he lost by a lot!

for years the dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been. now they are saying what a wonderful job the trump administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. actually this is true, except for what the democrats did. rigged election!
heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there, especially the organic rallies that are springing up all over the country, including a big one on saturday in d.c. i may even try to stop by and say hello. this election was rigged, from dominion all the way up & down!
now it is learned that the horrendous dominion voting system was used in arizona (and big in nevada). no wonder the result was a very close loss!
will be having a press conference from the rose garden in 15 minutes.
