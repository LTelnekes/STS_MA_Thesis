people working in the white house should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. i have asked that this adjustment be made. i am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. thank you!
oh no! what is going on? this is not good news, even for “indians”. cancel culture at work!
democrats weakened the signature verification (and other) safeguards in georgia. played & secretary of state, for fools. consent decree, which is terrible for republicans (and honest people!), must be opened up now - david, kelly, and i will then win!
what a fool governor of georgia is. could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. demand this clown call a special session and open up signature verification, now. otherwise, could be a bad day for two great senators on january 5th.
a great honor!
“why did the swing states stop counting in the middle of the night?” because they waited to find out how many ballots they had to produce in order to steal the rigged election. they were so far behind that they needed time, & a fake “water main break”, to recover!
first vaccine administered. congratulations usa! congratulations world!
wow. this report shows massive fraud. election changing result!
...deputy attorney general jeff rosen, an outstanding person, will become acting attorney general. highly respected richard donoghue will be taking over the duties of deputy attorney general. thank you to all!
just had a very nice meeting with attorney general bill barr at the white house. our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! as per letter, bill will be leaving just before christmas to spend the holidays with his family...
