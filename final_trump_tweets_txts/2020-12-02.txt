section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the u.s. to “big tech” (the only companies in america that have it - corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our national security & election integrity. our country can never be safe & secure if we allow it to stand.....

in arizona, it turns out that 3% of the votes cast in the 100 count vote sling were tainted or worse. this would be, if carried forward, approximately 90,000 votes more than we would need to win the state. now we were granted a much larger sle to work with. wow!
