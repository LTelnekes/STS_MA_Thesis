looks like certain republican senators are getting cold feet with respect to the termination of big tech’s section 230, a national security and election integrity must. for years, all talk, no action. termination must be put in defense bill!!!
thank you to represenative mo brooks!
the “republican” governor of georgia, , and the secretary of state, must immediately allow a signature verification match on the presidential election. if that happens, we quickly and easily win the state and importantly, pave the way for a big david and kelly win!
georgia hearings now on . amazing!
thank you to representative mo brooks!
wow! blockbuster testimony taking place right now in georgia. ballot stuffing by dems when republicans were forced to leave the large counting room. plenty more coming, but this alone leads to an easy win of the state!
congratulations !
