what does gsa being allowed to preliminarily work with the dems have to do with continuing to pursue our various cases on what will go down as the most corrupt election in american political history? we are moving full speed ahead. will never concede to fake ballots & “dominion”.
poll: 79 percent of trump voters believe ‘election was stolen‘ via they are 100% correct, but we are fighting hard. our big lawsuit, which spells out in great detail all of the ballot fraud and more, will soon be filled. rigged election!
no!
thank you randy, working hard to clean up the stench of the 2020 election hoax!
are you listening republicans?
“in wisconsin, somebody has to be indefinitely confined in order to vote absentee. in the past there were 20,000 people. this past election there were 120,000...and republicans were locked out of the vote counting process.”
that says it all about mattis. obama fired him. i should have fired him sooner. did best work after he was gone. world’s most overrated general!
remember, the gsa has been terrific, and emily murphy has done a great job, but the gsa does not determine who the next president of the united states will be.
on behalf of the entire trump family, i want to wish every american a healthy and happy thanksgiving! today we gathered in the rose garden to continue a beloved annual tradition: the official presidential pardon of a very fortunate thanksgiving turkey....
america first!!!
