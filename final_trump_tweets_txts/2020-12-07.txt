gee, what a surprise. has anyone informed the so-called (says he has no power to do anything!) governor & his puppet lt. governor , that they could easily solve this mess, & win. signature verification & call a special session. so easy!
a must watch! hope the lawyers are all taking notes. all facts, do not flag this twitter!
so true. no way we lost this election!
true. great debate for kelly!
watch at 11:00 p.m. (now!) and at 12:00 a.m. on the great election fraud of 2020!
the republican governor of georgia refuses to do signature verification, which would give us an easy win. whatâ€™s wrong with this guy? what is he hiding?
