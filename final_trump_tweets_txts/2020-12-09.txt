this was not my case as has been so incorrectly reported. the case that everyone has been waiting for is the state’s case with texas and numerous others joining. it is very strong, all criteria met. how can you have a presidency when a vast majority think the election was rigged?
we will be intervening in the texas (plus many other states) case. this is the big one. our country needs a victory!
germany has consistently been used by my obnoxious critics as the country that we should follow on the way to handle the china virus. so much for that argument. i love germany - vaccines on the way!!!
rigged election!
there is massive evidence of widespread fraud in the four states (plus) mentioned in the texas suit. just look at all of the tapes and affidavits!
stock markets at new all time highs!!!
this case had nothing to do with me. fake news (as usual!).
we will soon be learning about the word “courage”, and saving our country. i received hundreds of thousands of legal votes more, in all of the swing states, than did my opponent. all data taken after the vote says that it was impossible for me to lose, unless fixed!
no candidate has ever won both florida and ohio and lost. i won them both, by a lot! supremecourt
overturn
if somebody cheated in the election, which the democrats did, why wouldn’t the election be immediately overturned? how can a country be run like this?
at 10:00 p.m. on election evening, we were at 97% win with the so-called “bookies”.
wow! at least 17 states have joined texas in the extraordinary case against the greatest election fraud in the history of the united states. thank you!
