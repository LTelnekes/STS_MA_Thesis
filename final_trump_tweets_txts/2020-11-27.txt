a must read. impossible for biden to have overcome these, and even greater, odds!
i gave a long news conference today after wishing the military a happy thanksgiving, & realized once again that the fake news media coordinates so that the real message of such a conference never gets out. primary point made was that the 2020 election was rigged, and that i won!
twitter is sending out totally false “trends” that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. they make it up, and only negative “stuff”. same thing will happen to twitter as is happening to daytime. also, big conservative discrimination!
for purposes of national security, section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!
wow! twitter bans highly respected pennsylvania state senator doug mastriano after he did a great job of leading a hearing on the 2020 election fraud. they and the fake news, working together, want to silence the truth. can’t let that happen. this is what communist countries do!
big news: pennsylvania poll watcher: usb drives uploaded to machines, gave biden thousands of votes. says 47 usb drives are now missing. every upload gave biden 50,000 votes.
“president trump nominates record number of federal judges.”
report: biden’s thanksgiving day address gets just 1000 views online, a record low. observers say a candidate with “80,000,000” votes would get many more online viewers. numbers don’t lie, or add up!
no, the 2020 election was a total scam, we won by a lot (and will hopefully turn over the fraudulent result), but we must get out and help david and kelly, two great people. otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people. i will be in georgia on saturday!
yesterday’s news conference being broadcast in full now on . enjoy!
all newly rebuilt military!
so much truth!
big tech and the fake news media have partnered to suppress. freedom of the press is gone, a thing of the past. that’s why they refuse to report the real facts and figures of the 2020 election or even, where’s hunter!
biden can only enter the white house as president if he can prove that his ridiculous “80,000,000 votes” were not fraudulently or illegally obtained. when you see what happened in detroit, atlanta, philadelphia & milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he’s got a big unsolvable problem!
biden did poorly in big cities (politico), except those of detroit (more votes than people!), philadelphia, atlanta and milwaukee, which he had to win. not surprisingly, they are all located in the most important swing states, and are long known for being politically corrupt!
the restaurant business is being absolutely decimated. congress should step up and help. time is of the essence!
